# Uniweb Enhancer ([Github](https://github.com/andrea-k9/uniweb-enhancer))
This extension modifies the user interface of [Uniweb's booklet](https://uniweb.unipd.it/auth/studente/Libretto/LibrettoHome.do): you can change your grades (even for ungraded exams!) and simulate the new average!
> Don't worry: changes to your grades are only made on your computer, teachers won't see anything different, and when you refresh the page, everything will be as it was before.
